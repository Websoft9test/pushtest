## Ports

Open or close ports by **[Security Group Setting](https://support.websoft9.com/docs/faq/tech-instance.html)** of your Cloud Server to decide whether the port can be accessed from Internet.  

You can run the cmd `netstat -tunlp` to check all related ports.  

The following are the ports you may use:

| Name | Number | Use |  Necessity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCP | 80 | HTTP to access RabbitMQ | Required |
| TCP | 443 | HTTPS to access RabbitMQ | Optional |
| TCP | 3306 | Remote to access MySQL | Optional |
| TCP | 9003 | Use port to access RabbitMQ | Optional |
| TCP | 9002 | RabbitMQ Document Server on Docker | Optional |
| TCP | 9090 | phpMyAdmin on Docker | Optional |


## Version

You can see the version on product pages at Marketplace. However, after being deployed to your server, the components will be updated automatically, resulting in a certain change in the version number. Therefore, run the command on the server to view the exact version number. 

```shell
# Check all components version
sudo cat /data/logs/install_version.txt

# Linux Version
lsb_release -a

# Nginx  Version
nginx -V

# Java version
java -v

# Docker Version
docker -v

# erlang  Version
yum info erlang
apt show erlang

# RabbitMQ version
rabbitmqctl status | grep RabbitMQ*
```
